# Gmonkey

Gmonkey is and interpreted language written in go, implementated as described in [Write an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com).

This repo contains the intrepreter for Gmonkey. I am near the end of second chapter in the book. So, it's not even a working interpreter as of now. But it's a work in progress.

Currenly you can checkout the lexer working in the REPL.

## REPL

To run the REPL:

` go run . ` or `go run main.go`
